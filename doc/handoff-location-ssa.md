# Picking up the r2sleigh architecture rewrite

This is a handoff. It says what was wrong, what was decided and why, exactly
where the tree stands, and what remains before the rewrite can be called
finished. Work happens in the `r2sleigh-arch` worktree on `arch/location-ssa`;
the primary checkout stays on its own branch so a bad day here costs nothing.

Read `doc/adr-location-ssa.md` first for the original design. This document
records what changed once the design met the code.

## What was actually broken

Four rendering defects turned out to share a single cause. SSA is built over
Sleigh varnodes, and `CanonicalStorageId { space, offset, size }` records a
*slice of a storage*, not a location. Two writes to the same register at
different widths are two unrelated identities. From that one fact:

- `unique_return_value_phi_for_block` saw an `EAX` phi and a `RAX` phi in the
  exit block, wanted exactly one candidate, and returned `None`. The function
  reported zero returns, the accumulator was not observable, no carrier binding
  was made, the loop body was eliminated, and the signature rendered `void`.
- `arg_c = arg_c` — a parameter assigned from itself.
- SIMD lane projections leaked into the output.
- A `setcc` was dropped on x86-64: `setge al` writes one byte and `inc eax`
  reads four, so the write did not look like it reached the read.

Runtime instrumentation confirmed the first one end to end. The other three have
the same shape and are filed as issues.

There was a second, quieter problem. A rendered identifier was a `String`. A
machine register that escaped the fold looked exactly like a declared local, and
the only way to notice was to scan the finished text for words that resolved to
nothing. That scan could be satisfied by *declaring the word*, and that is what
the pipeline had started doing — two passes existed for it.

## The design choice, and why

**A rendered name is an identifier the table issued, not a spelling.**
`CExpr::Var` holds a `SymbolId`. A `SymbolId` is minted only by declaring a
name. An undeclared name is therefore unconstructible rather than merely
detectable, which is a stronger property than any scan can give you.

Three consequences fell out, and each deleted code:

- Renaming moves a spelling *in the table*, so every mention moves at once and
  nothing walks the body keeping declarations and uses in step. That removed
  273 lines from `post_rename.rs` and 150 from `lib.rs`, plus two whole
  pipeline passes whose job was declaring names the renderer had already
  written down.
- `post_rename.rs` no longer mentions `CExpr` or `CStmt`. Renaming stopped
  being an expression-level concern.
- Two smells became type errors: identifiers were compared case-insensitively
  to decide whether two variables were the same, and a linear case-folding scan
  answered "did anything read this?".

**Spellings are `Rc<str>`.** Reading a spelling is a refcount bump and the table
borrow ends at the call. This matters because reading a spelling and then
building an expression is the common shape, building mints, and a caller holding
a borrow across the mint deadlocks. The hazard is closed by construction rather
than by discipline, and nothing is copied to achieve it. This is not a cache:
the text is stored once and referenced.

**The boundary that governs the whole step, and was not in the ADR.**
Three separate things were all called "name":

1. a `SymbolId` — a declared C identifier that may appear in output;
2. an SSA display name such as `rax_3` — an internal key into analysis side
   tables;
3. an arch predicate argument — a question about the *shape* of a spelling,
   like `starts_with("local_")`.

Converting every name-taking helper to `SymbolId` conflated all three and had to
be backed out roughly sixty times. The rule that holds is: **a helper whose
backing store is string-keyed keeps a string key, and a rendered identifier
reaching one bridges through `spelling()`.** Re-keying those stores belongs with
the location model in step 3; doing it halfway *is* the conflation.

**Analysis mints.** Twenty-five free functions in `flag_info`,
`prepared_semantic`, `stack_info` and `use_info` build `CExpr::Var` with no
table in reach. The alternative — analysis emits spellings and a later layer
declares them — needs a second expression type, which is the parallel pipeline
the working agreement forbids. So the table is threaded in and analysis
declares. A candidate that gets dropped costs one unused table entry.

**`CFunction` owns the table behind a `RefCell`**, so a pass can read names
while mutating the body via disjoint field borrows. It is moved in when the
function is built, never copied.

## A collision worth knowing about

Three separate structs — `PassEnv`, `FoldInputs`, and local test fixtures — each
had a field named `symbols` holding the binary's *address-to-name map*, and the
migration added the rendered-name table under the same name. Passes that meant
"the names this function declares" were silently reading "what the binary calls
the thing at this address". All three are `binary_symbols` now.

This is the same defect class the migration exists to eliminate, and it was
invisible until the types finally differed. Expect more of these.

## Where the tree stands

`cargo build --workspace` is clean. `cargo test -p r2dec --lib` runs:
**685 pass, 21 fail**, down from 83 failures when the suite first compiled.
Twenty-five commits from `763b28d`, net negative line count.

### An identifier now says which table issued it

The open question in the first draft of this document — that a `SymbolId` means
nothing outside its own table and nothing said so — is closed. `SymbolId`
carries a `TableId`, and reading one from another table refuses by name.

This was not bookkeeping. Turning the check on took failures from 36 to 42:
**six tests had been passing while resolving identifiers against the wrong
table.** Two tables of similar size resolve each other's identifiers to real but
wrong names, so a rendering says something it does not mean and never faults.
That class was live. The cost is four bytes per identifier and one integer
compare per lookup. Nothing in `r2dec` serialises the AST, so the brand cannot
reach output or disturb determinism — check that again before adding a field.

### Four root causes fixed, each a real defect

- The `structure` tests' `v()` helper built a table **per call**, so every
  reference it returned indexed a table already dropped. 31 failures.
- Writing `symbols.borrow_mut().declare_or_reuse(..)` inline holds the guard to
  the end of the statement, so a second declaration in the same statement
  deadlocks. `symbol::declare()` is a call, so the borrow drops at return —
  which is why `var_ref` was always safe. This makes the safe form the easy
  form and killed all 16 `RefCell` panics.
- Fixtures declared into a local table and then handed `CFunction` a fresh empty
  one. `generate_function` copies `func.symbols`, so codegen read an empty
  table.
- `make_ctx` in the `lower` tests leaked a table of its own while the fixtures
  declared into another.

### The 21 that remain

- **7 cross-table reads**, each now naming both tables in its panic, in
  `fold::op_lower::tests` and the `lib.rs` test module. Same shape as the four
  above: find which table the code under test reads, and declare into it.
- **about 14 real assertion failures.** These are the interesting ones. At least
  three concern semantic member access failing to stay rooted at `argN`, which
  may be a genuine regression rather than a fixture problem. Diagnose before
  assuming they are migration debris.

## What is left

**Step 2 is not finished.** 83 failing tests, and the cross-table question above
is unanswered.

**Not yet validated against either corpus.** Nothing here has been checked
against `/tmp/r2stest` (the crc32 and FNV hash functions) or
`tests/gold/flag_materialisation.c`. Zero compiler errors was never the
milestone; rendering those two corpora correctly is. When comparing obligation
counts, compare rendered-as-a-share-of-total **only when the totals match** — the
repair pass creates obligations for its own inserted ops, and I got this
comparison wrong twice, in both directions.

**Steps 3 through 7 are untouched:**

3. **Location model substrate.** Locations replace varnodes; lanes become
   sub-ranges. This is the fix for all four original defects and the point of
   the exercise. Everything so far is the substrate it needs.
4. **Make the repair pass conditional.** Not deletable — it does real work for
   SIMD lanes — but it should not run unconditionally.
5. Guard that no facts method is shaped like a rendering decision.
6. Flag demotion, target model extraction, budget-as-ledger.
7. Collapse the `UseInfo` split: production takes one path and the tests take
   the other, so the tests are not exercising what ships.

Also open: issue #63, the dropped `setcc` on x86-64.

## How to work on this

Scripted transforms across this tree are dangerous, and I say that from
experience: seven of mine produced syntactically plausible damage, including
writing a parameter into `pub(crate)` twice, a `count=1` regex that deleted the
wrong function's binding across six files, and a receiver walk that emitted
`param.self.spelling(...)`. Two broke production and were restored from commits.

Three habits would have caught all of it:

- **Read the diff, not the error count.** The `count=1` bug sat in the tree
  while the count went *down*.
- **Scope every transform to `#[cfg(test)]` explicitly**, anchored on
  `#[cfg(test)]` immediately followed by `mod tests` — not the first
  `#[cfg(test)]` in the file, because several files carry it on individual
  fields.
- **Check `cargo build --lib` separately from `cargo test --no-run`** after
  every batch. A parse error makes rustc discard a whole `impl` block, which
  suppresses every real error inside it and looks like sudden progress.

Commit continuously. Every restore in this session came from a commit, which is
why nothing was lost.
