# Picking up the r2sleigh architecture rewrite

This is a handoff. It says what was wrong, what was decided and why, exactly
where the tree stands, and what remains before the rewrite can be called
finished. Work happens in the `r2sleigh-arch` worktree on `arch/location-ssa`;
the primary checkout stays on its own branch so a bad day here costs nothing.

Read `doc/adr-location-ssa.md` first for the original design. This document
records what changed once the design met the code.

## What was actually broken

Four rendering defects turned out to share a single cause. SSA is built over
Sleigh varnodes, and `CanonicalStorageId { space, offset, size }` records a
*slice of a storage*, not a location. Two writes to the same register at
different widths are two unrelated identities. From that one fact:

- `unique_return_value_phi_for_block` saw an `EAX` phi and a `RAX` phi in the
  exit block, wanted exactly one candidate, and returned `None`. The function
  reported zero returns, the accumulator was not observable, no carrier binding
  was made, the loop body was eliminated, and the signature rendered `void`.
- `arg_c = arg_c` — a parameter assigned from itself.
- SIMD lane projections leaked into the output.
- A `setcc` was dropped on x86-64: `setge al` writes one byte and `inc eax`
  reads four, so the write did not look like it reached the read.

Runtime instrumentation confirmed the first one end to end. The other three have
the same shape and are filed as issues.

There was a second, quieter problem. A rendered identifier was a `String`. A
machine register that escaped the fold looked exactly like a declared local, and
the only way to notice was to scan the finished text for words that resolved to
nothing. That scan could be satisfied by *declaring the word*, and that is what
the pipeline had started doing — two passes existed for it.

## The design choice, and why

**A rendered name is an identifier the table issued, not a spelling.**
`CExpr::Var` holds a `SymbolId`. A `SymbolId` is minted only by declaring a
name. An undeclared name is therefore unconstructible rather than merely
detectable, which is a stronger property than any scan can give you.

Three consequences fell out, and each deleted code:

- Renaming moves a spelling *in the table*, so every mention moves at once and
  nothing walks the body keeping declarations and uses in step. That removed
  273 lines from `post_rename.rs` and 150 from `lib.rs`, plus two whole
  pipeline passes whose job was declaring names the renderer had already
  written down.
- `post_rename.rs` no longer mentions `CExpr` or `CStmt`. Renaming stopped
  being an expression-level concern.
- Two smells became type errors: identifiers were compared case-insensitively
  to decide whether two variables were the same, and a linear case-folding scan
  answered "did anything read this?".

**Spellings are `Rc<str>`.** Reading a spelling is a refcount bump and the table
borrow ends at the call. This matters because reading a spelling and then
building an expression is the common shape, building mints, and a caller holding
a borrow across the mint deadlocks. The hazard is closed by construction rather
than by discipline, and nothing is copied to achieve it. This is not a cache:
the text is stored once and referenced.

**The boundary that governs the whole step, and was not in the ADR.**
Three separate things were all called "name":

1. a `SymbolId` — a declared C identifier that may appear in output;
2. an SSA display name such as `rax_3` — an internal key into analysis side
   tables;
3. an arch predicate argument — a question about the *shape* of a spelling,
   like `starts_with("local_")`.

Converting every name-taking helper to `SymbolId` conflated all three and had to
be backed out roughly sixty times. The rule that holds is: **a helper whose
backing store is string-keyed keeps a string key, and a rendered identifier
reaching one bridges through `spelling()`.** Re-keying those stores belongs with
the location model in step 3; doing it halfway *is* the conflation.

**Analysis mints.** Twenty-five free functions in `flag_info`,
`prepared_semantic`, `stack_info` and `use_info` build `CExpr::Var` with no
table in reach. The alternative — analysis emits spellings and a later layer
declares them — needs a second expression type, which is the parallel pipeline
the working agreement forbids. So the table is threaded in and analysis
declares. A candidate that gets dropped costs one unused table entry.

**`CFunction` owns the table behind a `RefCell`**, so a pass can read names
while mutating the body via disjoint field borrows. It is moved in when the
function is built, never copied.

## A collision worth knowing about

Three separate structs — `PassEnv`, `FoldInputs`, and local test fixtures — each
had a field named `symbols` holding the binary's *address-to-name map*, and the
migration added the rendered-name table under the same name. Passes that meant
"the names this function declares" were silently reading "what the binary calls
the thing at this address". All three are `binary_symbols` now.

This is the same defect class the migration exists to eliminate, and it was
invisible until the types finally differed. Expect more of these.

## Where the tree stands

`cargo build --workspace` is clean. `cargo test -p r2dec --lib` compiles and
runs: **623 pass, 83 fail.** Thirteen commits from `763b28d` to `1dad007`, net
negative line count.

The 83 failures are not noise and not merely test bugs:

- **53 are `index out of bounds: the len is 0 but the index is 0`** in
  `SymbolTable::get`. A `SymbolId` from one table is being looked up in a
  different, empty table. Concentrated in `structure::tests` (31),
  `analysis::predicate` (6), `analysis::lower` (6).
- **16 are `RefCell already borrowed`** — the hazard named above, fired from
  fixtures that write `symbols.borrow_mut().declare_or_reuse(..)` inline inside
  a struct literal that also declares elsewhere in the same statement. The
  guard lives to the end of the statement.
- **about five are real assertion failures**, including one where a semantic
  member access should stay rooted at `argN` and does not.

**The 53 are the important ones, and they expose a genuine gap in the design.**
A `SymbolId` is only meaningful in the table that issued it, and nothing in the
type system says which table that is. Fixtures make per-test tables, the
pipeline makes its own, ids cross between them, and the index lands in the
wrong `Vec`. Decide this before touching anything else. The options are roughly:

- brand the table (`SymbolId<'t>`, or a table id inside `SymbolId`) so a
  cross-table lookup does not compile, or at minimum panics saying what
  happened;
- make `get` return `Option` and force callers to say what an unknown id means;
- accept one table per rendered function as an invariant and make the tests
  share the pipeline's table rather than building their own.

The first matches the spirit of the rest of this work — make the wrong thing
unconstructible rather than detectable — and is also the most churn.

## What is left

**Step 2 is not finished.** 83 failing tests, and the cross-table question above
is unanswered.

**Not yet validated against either corpus.** Nothing here has been checked
against `/tmp/r2stest` (the crc32 and FNV hash functions) or
`tests/gold/flag_materialisation.c`. Zero compiler errors was never the
milestone; rendering those two corpora correctly is. When comparing obligation
counts, compare rendered-as-a-share-of-total **only when the totals match** — the
repair pass creates obligations for its own inserted ops, and I got this
comparison wrong twice, in both directions.

**Steps 3 through 7 are untouched:**

3. **Location model substrate.** Locations replace varnodes; lanes become
   sub-ranges. This is the fix for all four original defects and the point of
   the exercise. Everything so far is the substrate it needs.
4. **Make the repair pass conditional.** Not deletable — it does real work for
   SIMD lanes — but it should not run unconditionally.
5. Guard that no facts method is shaped like a rendering decision.
6. Flag demotion, target model extraction, budget-as-ledger.
7. Collapse the `UseInfo` split: production takes one path and the tests take
   the other, so the tests are not exercising what ships.

Also open: issue #63, the dropped `setcc` on x86-64.

## How to work on this

Scripted transforms across this tree are dangerous, and I say that from
experience: seven of mine produced syntactically plausible damage, including
writing a parameter into `pub(crate)` twice, a `count=1` regex that deleted the
wrong function's binding across six files, and a receiver walk that emitted
`param.self.spelling(...)`. Two broke production and were restored from commits.

Three habits would have caught all of it:

- **Read the diff, not the error count.** The `count=1` bug sat in the tree
  while the count went *down*.
- **Scope every transform to `#[cfg(test)]` explicitly**, anchored on
  `#[cfg(test)]` immediately followed by `mod tests` — not the first
  `#[cfg(test)]` in the file, because several files carry it on individual
  fields.
- **Check `cargo build --lib` separately from `cargo test --no-run`** after
  every batch. A parse error makes rustc discard a whole `impl` block, which
  suppresses every real error inside it and looks like sudden progress.

Commit continuously. Every restore in this session came from a commit, which is
why nothing was lost.
