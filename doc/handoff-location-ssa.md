# Picking up the r2sleigh architecture rewrite

This is a handoff. It says what was wrong, what was decided and why, exactly
where the tree stands, and what remains before the rewrite can be called
finished. Work happens in the `r2sleigh-arch` worktree on `arch/location-ssa`;
the primary checkout stays on its own branch so a bad day here costs nothing.

Read `doc/adr-location-ssa.md` first for the original design. This document
records what changed once the design met the code.

## What was actually broken

Four rendering defects turned out to share a single cause. SSA is built over
Sleigh varnodes, and `CanonicalStorageId { space, offset, size }` records a
*slice of a storage*, not a location. Two writes to the same register at
different widths are two unrelated identities. From that one fact:

- `unique_return_value_phi_for_block` saw an `EAX` phi and a `RAX` phi in the
  exit block, wanted exactly one candidate, and returned `None`. The function
  reported zero returns, the accumulator was not observable, no carrier binding
  was made, the loop body was eliminated, and the signature rendered `void`.
- `arg_c = arg_c` — a parameter assigned from itself.
- SIMD lane projections leaked into the output.
- A `setcc` was dropped on x86-64: `setge al` writes one byte and `inc eax`
  reads four, so the write did not look like it reached the read.

Runtime instrumentation confirmed the first one end to end. The other three have
the same shape and are filed as issues.

There was a second, quieter problem. A rendered identifier was a `String`. A
machine register that escaped the fold looked exactly like a declared local, and
the only way to notice was to scan the finished text for words that resolved to
nothing. That scan could be satisfied by *declaring the word*, and that is what
the pipeline had started doing — two passes existed for it.

## The design choice, and why

**A rendered name is an identifier the table issued, not a spelling.**
`CExpr::Var` holds a `SymbolId`. A `SymbolId` is minted only by declaring a
name. An undeclared name is therefore unconstructible rather than merely
detectable, which is a stronger property than any scan can give you.

Three consequences fell out, and each deleted code:

- Renaming moves a spelling *in the table*, so every mention moves at once and
  nothing walks the body keeping declarations and uses in step. That removed
  273 lines from `post_rename.rs` and 150 from `lib.rs`, plus two whole
  pipeline passes whose job was declaring names the renderer had already
  written down.
- `post_rename.rs` no longer mentions `CExpr` or `CStmt`. Renaming stopped
  being an expression-level concern.
- Two smells became type errors: identifiers were compared case-insensitively
  to decide whether two variables were the same, and a linear case-folding scan
  answered "did anything read this?".

**Spellings are `Rc<str>`.** Reading a spelling is a refcount bump and the table
borrow ends at the call. This matters because reading a spelling and then
building an expression is the common shape, building mints, and a caller holding
a borrow across the mint deadlocks. The hazard is closed by construction rather
than by discipline, and nothing is copied to achieve it. This is not a cache:
the text is stored once and referenced.

**The boundary that governs the whole step, and was not in the ADR.**
Three separate things were all called "name":

1. a `SymbolId` — a declared C identifier that may appear in output;
2. an SSA display name such as `rax_3` — an internal key into analysis side
   tables;
3. an arch predicate argument — a question about the *shape* of a spelling,
   like `starts_with("local_")`.

Converting every name-taking helper to `SymbolId` conflated all three and had to
be backed out roughly sixty times. The rule that holds is: **a helper whose
backing store is string-keyed keeps a string key, and a rendered identifier
reaching one bridges through `spelling()`.** Re-keying those stores belongs with
the location model in step 3; doing it halfway *is* the conflation.

**Analysis mints.** Twenty-five free functions in `flag_info`,
`prepared_semantic`, `stack_info` and `use_info` build `CExpr::Var` with no
table in reach. The alternative — analysis emits spellings and a later layer
declares them — needs a second expression type, which is the parallel pipeline
the working agreement forbids. So the table is threaded in and analysis
declares. A candidate that gets dropped costs one unused table entry.

**`CFunction` owns the table behind a `RefCell`**, so a pass can read names
while mutating the body via disjoint field borrows. It is moved in when the
function is built, never copied.

## A collision worth knowing about

Three separate structs — `PassEnv`, `FoldInputs`, and local test fixtures — each
had a field named `symbols` holding the binary's *address-to-name map*, and the
migration added the rendered-name table under the same name. Passes that meant
"the names this function declares" were silently reading "what the binary calls
the thing at this address". All three are `binary_symbols` now.

This is the same defect class the migration exists to eliminate, and it was
invisible until the types finally differed. Expect more of these.

## Where the tree stands

`cargo build --workspace` is clean. `cargo test -p r2dec --lib` runs:
**the whole workspace is green** -- `cargo test --workspace` has no failing test
in any crate, r2dec at 706 and r2ssa at 401, down from 1323 compile errors and
83 failures when the suite first built. Forty-eight commits from `763b28d`, net
negative line count.

On the corpus, `pdd` renders 47 of 60 functions across x86-64 and arm64 at `-O0`
and `-O2`, and both flag binaries render completely. The thirteen that do not
fail at the lift, not the renderer: `Unable to resolve constructor`, `genuine
basic block contains instructions after a control terminator`, `machine-derived
CFG contradicts the owned advisory source CFG`. Those predate this work.

### An identifier now says which table issued it

The open question in the first draft of this document — that a `SymbolId` means
nothing outside its own table and nothing said so — is closed. `SymbolId`
carries a `TableId`, and reading one from another table refuses by name.

This was not bookkeeping. Turning the check on took failures from 36 to 42:
**six tests had been passing while resolving identifiers against the wrong
table.** Two tables of similar size resolve each other's identifiers to real but
wrong names, so a rendering says something it does not mean and never faults.
That class was live. The cost is four bytes per identifier and one integer
compare per lookup. Nothing in `r2dec` serialises the AST, so the brand cannot
reach output or disturb determinism — check that again before adding a field.

### Four root causes fixed, each a real defect

- The `structure` tests' `v()` helper built a table **per call**, so every
  reference it returned indexed a table already dropped. 31 failures.
- Writing `symbols.borrow_mut().declare_or_reuse(..)` inline holds the guard to
  the end of the statement, so a second declaration in the same statement
  deadlocks. `symbol::declare()` is a call, so the borrow drops at return —
  which is why `var_ref` was always safe. This makes the safe form the easy
  form and killed all 16 `RefCell` panics.
- Fixtures declared into a local table and then handed `CFunction` a fresh empty
  one. `generate_function` copies `func.symbols`, so codegen read an empty
  table.
- `make_ctx` in the `lower` tests leaked a table of its own while the fixtures
  declared into another.

### How the 83 failures were fixed

Every one was a real defect that the branding exposed, not churn:

- Two contexts reading one fixture each held their own table. The fold context
  owns its table behind an `Rc` now, so they share one. Cloning was the trap: a
  copy taken before the last name is declared is missing it, and the panic moves
  from a table mismatch to an index past the end.
- `structure`'s `v()` helper built a table **per call**, so every reference
  indexed a table already dropped (31).
- `single_evaluation`'s `call`, `assign` and `function` helpers did the same, so
  two references to one spelling were different identifiers and the structural
  comparisons could never hold (4).
- `symbols.borrow_mut().declare_or_reuse(..)` written inline holds the guard to
  the end of the statement, so a second declaration in the same statement
  deadlocks. `symbol::declare()` is a call, so the borrow drops at return —
  which is why `var_ref` was always safe. This makes the safe form the easy form
  (16).
- Fixtures declared into a local table then handed `CFunction` a fresh empty
  one; `generate_function` copies `func.symbols`, so codegen read nothing.
- `make_ctx` in the `lower` tests leaked a table of its own.
- Assertions grepped `format!("{expr:?}")` for a name. A reference carries an
  identifier, so the debug rendering no longer contains a spelling. The
  `spelled()` helper in `pipeline.rs` reads them back out of the table; that is
  what those assertions always meant.
- `test_use_info_deterministic` compared two runs under two contexts, so it was
  asking whether two tables have the same identity rather than whether the
  analysis is deterministic. One function has one table.

## What is left

**Step 2 is not finished.** 83 failing tests, and the cross-table question above
is unanswered.

**Corpus validation now runs, and it found a production bug.** Read the trap
first: `pdc` is radare2's own pseudo-decompiler, not r2sleigh's renderer. It
answers happily with raw register arithmetic. Comparing `pdc` across two builds
of this plugin proves nothing, and I made exactly that mistake before catching
it. The command is `pdd`, driven as `r2 -qc "a:sla; aaa; s <fn>; pdd" <binary>`.

Driven correctly, the rewritten tree rendered **nothing** where the baseline
rendered thirty lines, and the reason was the table brand firing in production:

    identifier from table TableId(1) read in table TableId(5)

Every pass held its own symbol table. Analysis minted into one, the fold context
into a second, and handing `CFunction` its table with `mem::take` left the fold
context holding a third that the take had just emptied. The renderer was reading
identifiers no table it held had issued. Before branding this did not crash --
it resolved to a real but wrong name, and the rendering went out saying
something it did not mean.

There is now exactly one table per rendered function, an `Rc`, shared by every
pass that declares or reads a name. Sharing is a refcount bump; the copies it
replaced were the bug.

`sym._fnv1a64` at `-O2` renders its hash chain again -- the function whose empty
body and `void` signature began this work. Its ledger reads `122 source
obligations: 100 rendered, 0 elided, 2 refused, 20 unaccounted` against the
previous `100 of 120 owned, 2 unsupported`, and the junk locals `ESI`, `RSI_4`
and `tregalias_phi_156_1_0` are gone.

Across the corpus most functions render on x86-64 and arm64 at `-O0` and `-O2`.
The remaining empty ones fail at the lift, not the table: `Unable to resolve
constructor`, `genuine basic block contains instructions after a control
terminator`, `machine-derived CFG contradicts the owned advisory source CFG`.
Those are engine limits and predate this work.

### The undeclared-mention check, and what it found

`unrendered::names_mentioned_without_a_declaration` is a set difference: every
identifier the body mentions, less every one the function declares. It runs
after the last pass that can rename anything, and what it finds is written into
the rendering as a `r2dec defect:` comment rather than left for a reader to
notice.

This question could not be asked cheaply before. A reference was a `String`, so
the only way to ask was to scan finished text for words that resolve to nothing,
and **that scan could be satisfied by declaring the word** -- which is what the
pipeline had started doing. Two passes existed for it and both are deleted.

Twenty-three functions across the hash and flag corpora mention a name they
never declare. The names fall into three kinds, and they are three different
defects:

- **Raw machine registers**: `al`, `rax`, `rsi`, `cf_1`, `d2`, `q2`,
  `xmm6_5`. A register that escaped the fold. This is the original problem the
  symbol table was built to make visible.
- **Call targets rendered as variables**: `sub_2c4`, `sub_504`. The AST has
  `CExpr::External` carrying an `ExternalKind`, precisely so that calling
  something outside the function is a claim a reader can check. These are
  `CExpr::Var` instead, which bypasses it. `ExternalKind` is defined and, apart
  from two intrinsic sites in `analysis/lower.rs`, unused.
- **Placeholder text used as a name**: `register`, `stack slot`. `stack slot`
  contains a space and is not a C identifier at all. It does not reach the
  printed C, so something downstream drops or replaces it, but it is in the
  finished AST.

`arg_c = arg_c` no longer reproduces anywhere in the corpus -- zero
self-assignments across every rendered function.

### Where the undeclared-name work ended up

Three fixes landed and the defect is now fully characterised.

An induction variable a `for` introduces is declared, and so is a name assigned
in a `for`'s condition. Structuring rewrites loops *after* the pass that
declares carriers, so those names appear when nothing is left to notice them.
Extending the old collector to reach a `for`'s init changed nothing, and that is
what identified the cause as ordering rather than coverage.

**Only names the body assigns are declared.** A name that is only ever read has
no definition, and declaring it would turn a dangling reference into valid C
that reads uninitialised memory: the defect would compile and stop being
reported. Driving the count to zero that way was available and is wrong.

So every remaining report is a dangling read, by construction rather than by
observation. `sym._combined` refuses 117 of its 187 obligations and then reads
`local_28` and `t6080`, which no surviving statement writes. The comment names
that -- `N name(s) read with no definition` -- so it points at the dropped
definition rather than at the declaration that would have hidden it.

Counts across the two corpora: 23 functions and 55 distinct names down to 18 and
46. The names go to stderr under `R2SLEIGH_NAME_DEFECTS`, because the comment
renderer replaces machine tokens with prose and would otherwise print the
substitution rather than the name.

### Two more spelling tables, and why replacing them stalled

`is_return_value_register` and `is_control_return_target` in `r2ssa::semantic`
are the same hack as the phi picker's: a list of register spellings, `rax | eax
| ax | al | xmm0 | st0 | x0 | w0 | r0 | v0` for one and `pc | lr | ra | x30 |
rip | eip` for the other. They answer for the architectures somebody wrote down
and say no to everything else. Six call sites between them, all in the return
analysis.

Replacing both with a location test works and the machine context threads to
every caller -- I did it, and the corpus was unchanged: `sym._fnv1a64` rendered
identically and coverage stayed at 47 of 60 functions. **I reverted it anyway**,
because it cannot be finished without answering a question the tests disagree
about.

The predicates need a stated convention. Production has one:
`build_function_internal_with_control` passes `source.convention_slots()`
through. The r2dec fixtures do not -- they build SSA through
`SsaArtifact::for_decompile_with_interface`, which has no way to say what a
function returns in. So with the change:

- `certified_call_result_owner_alias_requires_certified_stack_identity` fails
  unless the fixtures state a convention, because without one nothing is a
  return.
- `post_call_stack_store_does_not_fabricate_call_result_owner` fails when they
  do, because a call result then belongs to the result location rather than the
  stack slot a later store puts it in.

I first read that as the two tests being logically incompatible. **That claim is
not proven and is probably wrong.** The likelier explanation is that threading
the machine context changed behaviour somewhere in the call-result path -- once
`is_return_value_register` answers true for the result location, something in
the return analysis may consume the call result before the stack-owner
derivation sees it. That would be a defect in the change, not a contradiction
between the tests.

`post_call_stack_store_does_not_fabricate_call_result_owner` reads as: without
an exact source interface, do not invent a stack owner for a call result; with
one, derive it. That is consistent with wanting returns to be detectable. So the
two probably can hold together.

What is needed is to find where the call result stops reaching the stack-owner
derivation once returns are detected by location, rather than to pick whichever
fixture arrangement is green. Adding `SsaArtifact::for_decompile_with_convention`
so fixtures can state what they return in is the mechanical part and works; the
diagnosis above is the part that was not finished.

### The SIMD lane defect, located

`sym._crc32_table` in `hashes_x64_O2.o` is the clearest case of the leaked lane
projections, one of the four original defects. It reads `xmm6_5`, `xmm6_7`,
`xmm6_9`, `xmm6_11` and `xmm6_13` with no definition, around eighteen calls to
`callother("userop_193", ...)` -- an unmodelled Sleigh userop standing in for
the SIMD instruction. Several of those calls appear twice, once as the
right-hand side of an assignment and again as a bare statement, so the same
effect is rendered more than once.

This is the piece the location model is for. A lane is a sub-range of a
register's location, and today `CanonicalStorageId` makes each lane width a
separate storage, so a write to one lane and a read of another look unrelated.
`CanonicalLocation` exists for this; what remains is for `SSAVar` to carry a
location and an extent rather than a name and a size, which is the substrate
change the rest of step 3 rests on.

**Steps 3 through 7 are untouched:**

3. **Location model substrate.** Locations replace varnodes; lanes become
   sub-ranges. This is the fix for all four original defects and the point of
   the exercise. Everything so far is the substrate it needs.

   `CanonicalLocation` exists now (`r2source::contracts`) and
   `CanonicalStorageId::location()` returns it. Nothing reads it yet. I tried to
   spend it immediately on the obvious target and backed out; the reason is
   worth knowing before you try the same thing.

   `return_value_register_family` in `r2ssa::semantic` is a hardcoded table
   mapping `rax|eax|ax|al` to one family, `x0|w0` to another, and so on. It is
   spelling knowledge standing in for a location, and it only works on the
   architectures somebody listed. Replacing it with "same location" is exactly
   what the location model is for, and the machine context reaches the phi
   picker in two hops, which I threaded successfully.

   It does not finish, because the phi picker cannot reach the location that
   holds a return value. **The contract already models it**:
   `SourceConventionSlots::result_slot` is exactly the location the convention
   leaves a result in, alongside `argument_slots`. What is missing is plumbing --
   `SourceMachineContext` does not carry the convention slots, so nothing inside
   `r2ssa::semantic` can ask for them.

   Do not work around that by grouping every register phi by location and
   dropping the return-register test. It changes what the rule means: today a
   block with `rbx` and `rax` phis answers `rax` because `rbx` is not in the
   family table, and a location-only rule would see two locations and refuse.
   That trades a hack you can see for one you cannot.

   So step 3 begins by carrying the convention slots on the machine context.
   Then the picker asks whether a phi's location is the result slot's location,
   the family table deletes, and it deletes for every architecture rather than
   the eight somebody listed.
4. **Make the repair pass conditional.** Not deletable — it does real work for
   SIMD lanes — but it should not run unconditionally.
5. Guard that no facts method is shaped like a rendering decision.
6. Flag demotion, target model extraction, budget-as-ledger.
7. Collapse the `UseInfo` split: production takes one path and the tests take
   the other, so the tests are not exercising what ships.

Also open: issue #63, the dropped `setcc` on x86-64.

## How to work on this

Scripted transforms across this tree are dangerous, and I say that from
experience: seven of mine produced syntactically plausible damage, including
writing a parameter into `pub(crate)` twice, a `count=1` regex that deleted the
wrong function's binding across six files, and a receiver walk that emitted
`param.self.spelling(...)`. Two broke production and were restored from commits.

Three habits would have caught all of it:

- **Read the diff, not the error count.** The `count=1` bug sat in the tree
  while the count went *down*.
- **Scope every transform to `#[cfg(test)]` explicitly**, anchored on
  `#[cfg(test)]` immediately followed by `mod tests` — not the first
  `#[cfg(test)]` in the file, because several files carry it on individual
  fields.
- **Check `cargo build --lib` separately from `cargo test --no-run`** after
  every batch. A parse error makes rustc discard a whole `impl` block, which
  suppresses every real error inside it and looks like sudden progress.

Commit continuously. Every restore in this session came from a commit, which is
why nothing was lost.
